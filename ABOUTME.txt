Hello, My name is Hao Truong. I am an undergraduate student at Oregon State University 
pusruing a Bachelor in Computer Science and a certificate in Cyber Security. Growing up
in a country that is not advanced in technology, I know how greatly advancing technology
development can benefit the society and improve lives of the others. I have joined several
engineering clubs during my shcool years to learn and develop my coding skills.
