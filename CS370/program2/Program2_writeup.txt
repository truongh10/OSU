1)  What hash functions did you choose and why (Hint: Cryptographic or non- cryptographic)? What is the output range of the hash functions? What is the size of the Bloom filter in each case?
I chose md5 (output range: 128), sha1 (output range: 160), sha224 (output range: 224), sha512 (output range: 512), sha3_256 (output range: 256). The size of the bloom filter in this case the size of dictionary times 8.


2)  How long does it take for your Bloom Filter to check 1 password in each case (3 hashes vs 5 hashes)? Why does one perform better than other if any?
  

It is because sha512 and sha3_256 are the slowest functions.
3)  What is the probability of False Positive in your Bloom Filter in each case? What is the probability of False Negative in your Bloom Filter?
False negatives are not possible in this case, therefore it is 0%.
false positive = 
False positive for 3 hashes: 
False positive for 3 hashes: 
4. How can you reduce the rate of False Positives?
In order to reduce the rate  of the False Positives, we can increase the number of the hash functions and the  size of the bloom filter.
